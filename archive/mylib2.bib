In the current version, the dataset covers 50 unstable countries from 1997 through 2010. {ACLED}’s disaggregation of civil war and transnational violent events allow for research on local level factors and the dynamics of civil and communal conflict. Findings from subnational conflict research challenges conclusions from larger national-level studies. In a brief descriptive analysis, the authors find that, on average, conflict covers 15\% of a state’s territory, but almost half of a state can be directly affected by internal wars.},

This article describes the differences between the two leading conflict events datasets, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Events Dataset ({UCDP} {GED}) and the Armed Conflict Location Events Dataset ({ACLED}), including their relative strengths and weaknesses. The aim of the article is to provide readers with some guidelines as to when these datasets should be used and when they should be avoided; it finds that those interested in subnational analyses of conflict should be wary of {ACLED}’s data because of uneven quality-control issues which can result in biased findings if left unchecked by the researcher. The article concludes that those interested in non-violent events such as troop movements have only {ACLED} to choose from, since {UCDP} has not coded such data, but again warns researchers to be wary of the quality of the data. Finally, while the creation of these datasets is a positive development, some caveats are raised in relation to both datasets about the reliance on media sources.},

Data diperoleh dengan wawancara mendalam, pengamatan serta studi kepustakaan dan dokumen, yang selanjutnya dianalisis dan dituangkan dalam bentuk kata-kata dan gambar sehingga memberikan gambaran yang jelas tentang obyek penelitian. Penelitian dilakukan di Kepolisian Resort Kota Yogyakarta dengan mengambil sampel beberapa Anggota Polresta Yogyakarta dan Polda {DIY}, pengunjuk rasa, masyarakat,dan ahli hukum.  Diskresi yang diterapkan oleh Anggota Kepolisian Resort Kota Yogyakarta dalam penanganan aksi unjuk rasa berupa toleransi atas pelanggaran pengunjuk rasa dalam hal surat pemberitahuan dan pelaksanaan aksi unjuk rasa, dan tindakan tersebut sekaligus merupakan pengabaian ketentuan dalam penanganan aksi unjuk rasa oleh Polisi. Kendalanya berupa pemahaman yang sempit serta dangkal terhadap diskresi oleh Polisi, sanksi yang diberikan bersifat personal, tanggapan negatif dari masyarakat dan pengunjuk rasa. Diskresi Anggota Kepolisian Resort Kota Yogyakarta dalam penanganan aksi unjuk rasa berakibat, yaitu: Pertama, akibat positif berupa terciptanya stabilitas wilayah di Kota Yogyakarta dan berdampak terhadap ketahanan wilayah pada aspek ideologi, politik, sosial budaya dan keamanan; Kedua yaitu, akibat negatif berupa anggapan masyarakat bahwa pelanggaran yang dilakukan oleh pengunjuk rasa merupakan hal yang benar, apabila diskresi yang diterapkan tidak dipahami dengan baik oleh polisi. Kendala yang ada harus diatasi dengan memberikan pemahaman dan pengetahuan yang cukup tentang diskresi kepolisian, khususnya kepada Anggota Kepolisian Resort Kota Yogyakarta, dan kepada masyarakat maupun pengunjuk rasa},

We survey progress in the development of conflict data and how this interacts with theory development and progress in research, drawing specifically on examples from the move towards a greater focus on disaggregation and agency in conflict research. We focus on disaggregation in three specific dimensions, namely the resolution of conflict data, agency in conflict data, and the specific strategies used in conflict, and we also discuss new efforts to study conflict processes beyond the use of violence. We look ahead to new challenges in conflict research and how data developments and the emergence of ‘big data’ push us to think harder about types of conflict, agency, and the ‘right’ level of aggregation for querying data and evaluating specific theories.},

Conflicts occur in every domain of life: family, work, and society, local and global. Conflict management, therefore, is an essential competency for each person. People differ largely in their emotional and behavioral responses to conflict and need to learn how to behave effectively in different conflict situations. This requires a contingency approach, first assessing the conflict situation, and then choosing a strategy, matching the goals of the party. In most situations, fostering cooperative relations will be most beneficial; however, this is also most challenging. Therefore, constructive conflict management strategies, including trust building and methods of constructive controversy, are emphasized. Conflict management, however, is broader than the interaction of the conflicting parties. Third-party interventions are an essential element of constructive conflict management, particularly the assessment of which parties are intervening in what ways at what escalation stage.},

	abstract = {For many reasons Rousseau's writings on international relations should interest students both of Rousseau and of world politics. The former have been celebrating the 200th anniversary of
              Emile
              and of
              The Social Contract
              . Those works, and the
              Discourse on Inequality
              have been analyzed incessantly and well. But Rousseau's ideas on war and peace, dispersed in various books and fragments, some of which are lost, have had only occasional attention, and some of that is of the hit-and-miss variety. Incomplete as his own treatment of the relations between states remains, the frequency and intensity of his references indicate the depth of his concern.},

On Aggression is one of his finest works, as well as the most controversial. Through an insightful and characteristically entertaining survey of animal behaviour, the Nobel Prize winner tracks the evolution of aggression throughout the animal world. He also raises some startling questions when he applies his observations of animal psychology to humankind. His conclusions caused an unprecedented controversy, culminating in a statement adopted by {UNESCO} in 1989 which appeared to condemn his work. Whether or not Lorenz actually claimed aggression is hard-wired into the human psyche, and that war is an inevitable result, is something readers can decide upon for themselves. However you react, there can be no doubting that in today's violent world this powerful work remains of paramount importance.},

	abstract = {Existing approaches to resolving civil wars are based primarily on the assumption that these wars result from conflicts of interest among rational individuals. However, peacebuilding efforts based on this approach usually fail in cases of ethnic civil war, leading sooner or later to renewed fighting. Symbolic politics theory suggests the problem with these peace efforts is that they pay insufficient attention to ameliorating the emotional and symbolic roots of extremist ethnic politics. The theory suggests that resolving ethnic war requires reconciliation–changing hostile attitudes to more moderate ones, assuaging ethnic fears, and replacing the intragroup symbolic politics of ethnic chauvinism with a politics that rewards moderation. The only policy tools for promoting such attitudinal and social changes are reconciliation initiatives such as leaders’ acknowledgement of their sides’ misdeeds, public education efforts such as media campaigns, and problem-solving workshops. Integrating such reconciliation initiatives into a comprehensive conflict resolution strategy, it is argued, is necessary for conflict resolution efforts to be more effective in ending ethnic civil wars.},

In the relative calm of late afternoons, feet draped casually over the seedy furnishings of the Tufts psychology department, we entertained each other with personal anecdotes about old cars, times spent lost on hold, and the Shakespearean concerns of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Lord and Lady Macbeth, and other notables. Eventually, informed by our many illustrations and the excitement that their repeated telling engendered in the two of us, we began to move more formally into trap analysis. How do you know a trap when you see one? What are the shared characteristics of all psychological traps, regardless of origin, scope, or complexity? What are the key conceptual elements in any effort to differentiate among the traps of the world? What factors make us more or less apt to fall prey to entrapment? These were some of the questions that arose during these initial meetings. A series of weekly meetings stretched over the ensuing years-interrupted temporarily by various exigencies-and led eventually to a research program that grew to involve a number of students and faculty colleagues. At the time, of course, we did not regard our work as a "research program"; rather, even as our experiments proceeded to answer two burning questions at a time, they managed to raise three or four new issues that we had not anticipated before.},

            Testing of the propositions on crisis escalation with the evidence from 388 international crises and 829 foreign policy crises from the end of 1918 to the end of 1988 reveals strong support for most of the postulated linkages in the crisis escalation model. Moreover, the evidence from ten indepth case studies indicates a widely shared pattern of coping with high stress, despite notable diversity in crisis attributes. This finding challenges conventional wisdom about how states cope with foreign policy crises.},

This collection of original essays and studies both calls for a closer connection between these fields and demonstrates the value of this interchange. Two introductory, programmatic essays by leading scholars in the two fields are followed by nine studies that directly illustrate the benefits of this type of cross-pollination and two closing essays. The studies variously examine the processes by which movements become organized and the role of movement processes within and among organizations. The topics covered range from globalization and transnational social movement organizations to community recycling programs."--Jacket.},

The aim of the primary study was to explore first-time parents’ postnatal educational needs. A subset of the data from the primary study (eight transcripts from interviews with fathers) was used for the secondary data analysis. The objectives of the secondary data analysis were to identify the challenges of using classic grounded theory with secondary data and to explore whether the re-analysis of primary data using a different methodology would yield a different outcome. Through the process of re-analysis a tentative theory emerged on ‘developing competency as a father’. Challenges encountered during this re-analysis included the small dataset, the pre-framed data, and limited ability for theoretical sampling. This re-analysis proved to be a very useful learning tool for author 1({LA}), who was a novice with classic grounded theory.},

They refer to the actual amount of wealth (money, land, vacation time) -- measurable rewards -- that each party receives. Though similar, these terms differ from the terms "win-win, win-lose, and lose-lose" which refer to wins or losses relative to expectations.[1] In a zero-sum situation, it is impossible for one party to advance its position without the other party suffering a corresponding loss.},

	abstract = {This article introduces {PA}-X, a peace agreement database designed to improve understanding of negotiated pathways out of conflict. {PA}-X enables scholars, mediators, conflict parties and civil society actors to systematically compare how peace and transition processes formalize negotiated commitments in an attempt to move towards peace. {PA}-X provides an archive and comprehensive census of peace agreements using a broad definition to capture agreements at all phases of peace processes in both intrastate and interstate conflict, from 1990 to 2016. These comprise ceasefire, pre-negotiation, substantive (partial and comprehensive), and implementation agreements, disaggregated by country/entity, region, conflict type, agreement type and stage of agreement totalling over 1,500 agreements in more than 140 peace and transition processes. {PA}-X provides the full text of agreements, and qualitative and quantitative coding of 225 categories relating to politics, law, security, development and implementation. Data can be aggregated or merged with conflict datasets, effectively providing many datasets within one database. {PA}-X supports new comparative research on peace agreements, but also on peace processes – enabling tracing of how actors and issues change over time – to inform understandings of conflict termination. We illustrate {PA}-X applications by showing that an intricate peace process history correlates with reduced likelihood of conflict recurrence, and that cumulative provisions addressing elections see the quality of subsequent post-conflict elections improve.},

Results from a qualitative study of 57 autonomous teams suggest that groups that improve or maintain top performance over time share 3 conflict resolution tendencies: (a) focusing on the content of interpersonal interactions rather than delivery style, (b) explicitly discussing reasons behind any decisions reached in accepting and distributing work assignments, and (c) assigning work to members who have the relevant task expertise rather than assigning by other common means such as volunteering, default, or convenience. The authors’ results also suggest that teams that are successful over time are likely to be both proactive in anticipating the need for conflict resolution and pluralistic in developing conflict resolution strategies that apply to all group members.},

Mass mediation of terrorism is a critical effort and a reflective way in trying to understand the practice and the articulation of the terrorism discourse in the world, especially on how the media enters and enlivens the practice of terrorism concept. This paper shows that the social construction of terrorism tends to be influenced by the Western mass media. In the construction of the mass media, the notion of terrorism today is the product of the discourse of the Western mass media. The dominance of the Western mass mediation terrorism resulted in the construction of terrorism discourse associated with the movement of Islamism and Communism. The mass mediation of terrorism demonstrates by Israeli atrocities against Palestinians tend to disregard aas acts of state terrorism. Threfore, the implication of state-centrist terrorism in counter terrorism policies are more oriented towards national security than human security.},

Several studies have found the systematic and representative inclusion of women in conﬂict resolution processes to signiﬁcantly increase the chances of sustainable peace. However, women’s contribution to peace processes are often underemphasized or ignored in conﬂict management research and praxis. It was not until the passage of {UN} Security Council Resolution 1325 and seven other related resolutions that critical attention was given to women’s role in the peace process. This article provides an in-depth review of the literature on women’s contribution to conﬂict resolution and peacebuilding. The overall aim is to provide researchers and actors in the global peace market with a distillation of the salient studies and ﬁndings from research on women’s involvement in the peace process. Such an eﬀort is necessary to bring together the sparse literature on women’s contribution to peace and to reveal existing gaps in the literature for future research.},

	abstract = {"This new Routledge Handbook offers a comprehensive, state-of-the-art overview of the meanings and uses of the term 'peacebuilding', and presents cutting-edge debates on the practices conducted in the name of peacebuilding. The term 'peacebuilding' has had remarkable staying power. Other terms, such as 'conflict resolution' have waned in popularity, while the acceptance and use of the term 'peacebuilding' has grown to the extent that it is the hegemonic and over-arching term for many forms of mediation, reconciliation and strategies to induce peace. Despite this, however, it is rarely defined and often used to mean different things to different audiences. Routledge Handbook of Peacebuilding aims to be a one-stop comprehensive resource on the literature and practices of contemporary peacebuilding. The book is organised into six key sections: - Section 1: Reading peacebuilding - Section 2: Approaches and cross-cutting themes - Section 3: Disciplinary approaches to peacebuilding - Section 4: Violence and security - Section 5: Everyday living and peacebuilding - Section 6: The infrastructure of peacebuilding This new Handbook will be essential reading for students of peacebuilding, mediation and post-conflict reconstruction, and of great interest to students of statebuilding, intervention, civil wars, conflict resolution, war and conflict studies and {IR} in general"--},

Contrary to some dominant interpretations of the ancient conception of friendship according to which it can only be understood as an obligatory reciprocity, I argue that friendship between fellow citizens is important because it contributes to the unity of both state and community by transmitting feelings of intimacy and solidarity. In that sense, it can be understood as an important relationship predicated on affection and generosity, virtues lacking from both contemporary politics and society that seem to be merely dominated by {PostEnlightenment} ideals. For Aristotle, friendship is important for society because it generates concord, articulating thus a basis for social unity and political agreement.},

	abstract = {The current study examines the effects of ingroup identification, outgroup trust, and intergroup forgiveness on intergroup contact quantity in the diverse cities of Sarajevo and Tuzla in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 455 individuals ranging in age from 14 to 102 self-reported as either Muslim, Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, or Other completed a questionnaire. Analyses revealed that ingroup identification was significantly and negatively correlated with intergroup contact quantity; however, ingroup identification was not significantly correlated with outgroup trust or intergroup forgiveness. The comparison between groups revealed significant group differences across all predictor and criterion variables. To confirm whether age or community background had a moderating effect on predicting the relation between ingroup identification, outgroup trust, and intergroup forgiveness on intergroup contact quantity, moderated regression analyses were conducted. Results revealed community background, ingroup identification, and outgroup trust were all significant contributors to the model; however, age and forgiveness were not. Taken as a whole, the entire model accounted for approximately 21\% of variability in intergroup contact quantity. The results from the current study reinforce the supposition that the two cities of Sarajevo and Tuzla in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot move towards reconciliation without first understanding the effect that strong ingroup identification has on mixing with the other diverse groups, and implementing proactive measures to enhance outgroup trust and cross-community outreach. Implementing these measures in the two cities of Sarajevo and Tuzla, along with other areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, may improve future intergroup relations and move the country closer to reconciliation and peace.},

	abstract = {This article purpose to think about interculturality in connection with what peace means, since many of the great conflicts in the history of humankind have been provoked by the failure to settle conflicts, by the absence of genuine dialogue and the inability to listen, thus producing violence among persons and among cultures. Therefore, to overcome these situations it is necessary a deep understanding of what peace means, as well as of its relation to justice and ethics. This will make it possible to seek the development of a positive interculturality, within a framework of peace. The existence of interculturality does not necessarily generate violence, even when there are conflicts. Transforming and overcoming these conflicts is the prerequisite for establishing peaceful intercultural relations. The argument in this article is that such transcendence is possible by resorting to the ethical imagination: a creative resource that makes what is absent and desired present and that generates possibilities thought to be inexistent in existing situations. The ethical imagination introduces a constructive view of social change in scenarios in which conflicts are deeply rooted, thereby, facilitating transformation.},

This raises the problem of the complementarity, coexistence and integration of different systems of knowledge. In fact, all of the human and social sciences are products of the post-Westphalian state system and so reify the state and its internal and international system and focus on this as the main source of political conﬂict. Conﬂicts, however, can arise from other distinctions involving gender, generation, race, class and so on. To contribute to peace building and conﬂict resolution, the social sciences must be globalized, developing theories that address conﬂicts at the levels of interpersonal interaction (micro), within countries (meso), between nations (macro), and between whole regions or civilizations (mega). Psychiatry and the ‘‘psy’’ disciplines can contribute to peace building and conﬂict resolution through understanding the interactions between processes at each of these levels and the mental health or illness of individuals.},

	abstract = {Two different ways of studying nonviolence are distinguished, depending on whether one uses explicit or implicit definitions of nonviolence used by others, whether writers on the subject or people who say they have practiced nonviolence, or one tries to develop one's own definition. The second approach is followed in this article in order to avoid ritualistic repetition of what others have regarded as nonviolence.
            Nonviolence is seen as an effort to influence, and a typology of influence techniques is developed, based on a simple model of how human actions are decided upon. This typology has as its main axis a distinction between positive and negative techniques of influence, i.e. the distinction between techniques that facilitate the execution of positive actions and techniques that impede the execution of negative actions. Nonviolence is then defined in a negative and a positive sense: negative nonviolence would include all possible techniques of influence short of 'deprivation of biological health' (called violence in the narrow sense) and positive nonviolence would exclude all negative techniques of influence (called violence in the broad sense).
            Current forms of nonviolent resistance or intervention are then examined in this perspective, and five main types are distinguished: a symbolic form that aims at pointing out to the adversary what are positive and what are negative actions; the use of physical means such as nonviolent sabotage, emigration, escape and their positive counterpart: close social contact; the use of positive and negative sanctions; the use of positive and negative 'amplification' (a way of increasing the impact the adversary's actions have, whether they are good or bad) and role-playing which includes such techniques as non cooperation and civil disobedience.
            In the final evaluation it is pointed out that adherents of nonviolence should do more to develop positive techniques of influence, and that many of the negative techniques differ little from biological violence.},

This point has been increasingly widely recognized in recent decades. For example, in the United States, a series of legislative initiatives and decrees, including the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, call on state bodies to define rules and procedures for negotiated “rule-making.” However, the role of negotiation in the policy cycle is often only implicitly recognized. It would be possible in this article to conceptualize a model recognizing the importance of negotiation theory and negotiating capabilities during the basic phases of the policy development cycle.},

The major findings of this study are as follows: (a) cultural individualism-collectivism had direct and indirect effects on conflict styles, (b) independent self-construal related positively with self-face and interdependent self-construal related positively with other-face, (c) self-face related positively with dominating conflict styles and other-face related positively with avoiding and integrating styles, and (d) face accounted for all of the total variance explained (100\% of 19\% total explained) in dominating, most of the total variance explained in integrating (70\% of 20\% total explained), and some of the total variance explained in avoiding (38\% of 21\% total explained) when considering face concerns, cultural individualismcollectivism, and self-construals.},

This toolkit focuses on specific techniques, resources and strategies for identifying, managing and preventing conflict-of-interest situations more effectively and increasing integrity in official decision-making which might be compromised by conflicts of interest. It also provides non-technical, practical help to enable officials to recognize problematic situations and help them to ensure that integrity and reputation are not compromised. The tools themselves are provided in generic form. They are based on examples of sound conflict-of-interest policy and practice drawn from various {OECD} member and non-member countries.

	abstract = {In theories of conflict management, managers’ conflict resolution skills have often been understood as their relational attitudes and ability to communicate, but choices of conflict resolution strategies in organizational management should also depend on the types of conflicts managers face. Understanding how a complex conflict situation involves one or several conflict types is a matter of understanding the deep structure of the conflict. Knowledge of such deep structure is a key to realizing what the conflict is about and how it should be resolved. The chapter uses conflict theory to distinguish between six conflict types that are especially important from an organizational perspective: interpretation conflicts, argumentation conflicts, value conflicts, interest conflicts, role conflicts and personal conflicts. After having clarified their signifcance in an organizational context, the chapter elucidates how knowledge of the conflict types and how they are logically related to each other can be used in managers’ conflict resolution practices. The last part of the chapter uses the conflict types to develop a model for practical conflict resolution in management. The model can be used as a tool for analyzing conflict situations—to gain a deeper and more systematic understanding of how the situations should be resolved in accordance with the best interest of the organization.},

Leading academics and practitioners present original essays discussing the theories, practices, and ethical challenges of integrating peacebuilding.

To answer this question, I construct a unique, extremely disaggregated data set drawn from social media sources to examine the behavior of Israel and Hamas during the 2012 Gaza Conflict. The data set contains conflict actions and international audience behavior at the hourly level for the full 179 hours of the conflict. Notably, I also include popular support for each side from international audiences on social media. I employ a Bayesian structural vector autoregression to measure how Israel’s and Hamas’s actions respond to shifts in international public support. The main finding is that shifts in public support reduce conflict intensity, particularly for Israel. This effect is greater than the effect of the key international actors—United States, Egypt, and United Nations. The results provide an important insight into how information technology is changing the role of international audiences in conflict.},

At the same time, scholars have turned to social media as a source of new data on conflict. I provide a framework for understanding social media’s influence on conflict through four interrelated points: (1) social media reduces the costs of communication, (2) it increases the speed and dissemination of information, (3) scholars should focus on the strategic interaction and competitive adaption of actors in response to communication technology changes, and (4) the new data that social media provides are not only an important resource, but also fundamentally change the information available to conflict actors, thereby shaping the conflict itself. In sum, social media’s influence on conflict defies simplistic explanations that argue that it privileges incumbents or challengers.},

Based on observation, interviews, participation and secondary documents the paper uses Coser’s theory of Social Conﬂict to suggest a four part model of how tourism engenders different forms of social conﬂict and ﬂuctuating alliances between stakeholders in an environment where tourism has been introduced by agents external to the indigenous community. The actors are ethnic groupings and members of those groups, governmental ofﬁcials at local, regional and national level, intermediaries of the tourism industry and private sector entrepreneurs drawn from the majority and minority ethnic groups. Tensions are identiﬁed as being based on beliefs, resources and power, and a sequential pattern of primacy is identiﬁed consistent with stages of the tourist area life cycle.},

Through a systematic literature review from 1986 to 2013, this paper examines social conﬂicts resulting from natural disasters. In this paper, a three-dimensional analysis, Description-Theme-Mechanism, is used to combine and analyze the current state of research, with the ultimate goal of clarifying the concept of social conﬂicts arising from natural disasters, summarizing existing research on the links between natural disasters and social conﬂicts, determining any signiﬁcant rules and trends, and providing recommendations and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {This research examines the relationships among individualism-collectivism ({IND}-{COL}), conflict management styles and conflict satisfaction. The authors aim to explain some of the inconclusive findings in the literature related to {IND}-{COL} and conflict styles by studying {IND}-{COL} as states, rather than dispositional traits. By taking a dynamic approach to conceptualizing {IND}-{COL} and measuring {IND}-{COL} over time, we investigate how different ratios of individualistic-to-collectivistic orientations are associated with different conflict management styles. Results show that individuals who employed a balanced focus (1:1 ratio) of both individualistic and collectivistic orientations utilized an integrative style in conflict more than individuals with either a strong individualistic or collectivistic orientation. Integrative style was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with conflict outcomes, processes, relationships, goal attainment and job satisfaction at work. Individuals with predominant focus on individualism utilized a dominating style more, whereas individuals with predominant focus on collectivism utilized obliging and avoiding styles. Furthermore, results show that state-level {IND}-{COL} is a better predictor of conflict management styles than trait-level {IND}-{COL}. Past research has focused on studying {IND}-{COL} primarily as a trait variable at the individual level, but we examine {IND}-{COL} as states in relation to conflict management styles. In addition, we investigate the combined and optimal effects of both individualism and collectivism value-orientations on conflict management styles.},

For the purpose, a vigorous theoretical framework for the examination of interrelationships among various normative concepts such as obligation, permission, prohibition, etc. is introduced, on the basis of the general theory on norms, deontic logic. By presuming several plausible laws on the way of the resolution of these conflicts and by introducing a two-dimensional representation of the conflicts with one axis representing the degree of imbalance and the other axis representing the cohesiveness of systems, a characterization method of conflict resolution processes is obtained, through which prediction and analysis of actual resolution processes can be done.},

In Indonesia, halal tourism has long been grown in the form of a pilgrimage undertaken by people with religious motivation. Along with the development of the global Islamic economy, then this type of tourism is undergoing a metamorphosis that requires a change in modern ranging from attractions, hotels, up to marketing. The paper combines descriptive of halal tourism industry and practices of Islamic law in Indonesia. This approach found that halal tourism industry can not be separated from the religious practices of the majority of Muslims in Indonesia, but also economically contribute to the local community, and tourist sites that display the beauty and hospitality for tourists Muslims and non-Muslims. This study concludes that halal tourism has become part of the national tourism industry to position Indonesia as a center for halal tourism in the world in the future.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of the resource-conflict link that has become most publicized—the rebel greed hypothesis—depends on just one of many plausible mechanisms that could underlie a relationship between resource dependence and violence. The author catalogues a large range of rival possible mechanisms, highlights a set of techniques that may be used to identify these mechanisms, and begins to employ these techniques to distinguish between rival accounts of the resource-conflict linkages. The author uses finer natural resource data than has been used in the past, gathering and presenting new data on oil and diamonds production and on oil stocks. The author finds evidence that (1) conflict onset is more responsive to the impacts of past natural resource production than to the potential for future production, supporting a weak states mechanism rather than a rebel greed mechanism; (2) the impact of natural resources on conflict cannot easily be attributed entirely to the weak states mechanism, and in particular, the impact of natural resources is independent of state strength; (3) the link between primary commodities and conflict is driven in part by agricultural dependence rather than by natural resources more narrowly defined, a finding consistent with a “sparse networks” mechanism; (4) natural resources are associated with shorter wars, and natural resource wars are more likely to end with military victory for one side than other wars. This is consistent with evidence that external actors have incentives to work to bring wars to a close when natural resource supplies are threatened. The author finds no evidence that resources are associated with particular difficulties in negotiating ends to conflicts, contrary to arguments that loot-seeking rebels aim to prolong wars.},

Terrorist groups’ variables in {EDTG} include ideology, main goals, start date, duration, base country, attack diversity, peak size, alternative endings (if relevant), and others. We display interesting features of {EDTG} through a series of tables and figures. Our {EDTG}-based survival analysis is at odds with some of the literature: for example, the demise of a leader and a larger share of transnational terrorist attacks increase the group’s odds of failure. After 2001, religious terrorist groups are more resilient than those with other ideologies. We also analyze terrorist group lethality and productivity.},

Alternative Dispute Resolution raises high expectations as to its potential for reaching consensual solutions, to be achieved through extended participation, transparency, and procedural justice. However, success or failure of negotiations do not depend only on the procedure, but also on factors exogenous to it. The ﬁrst section addresses the question: which exogenous factors affect the opportunities for an agreement in public policy negotiations and how do they exert their inﬂuence? Spatial representation of bargaining is used as an analytical framework. The second section shows how outside options, exogenous restrictions, and political directives for the negotiators affected the negotiation space and the ﬁnal outcome in a case of environmental mediation in Germany.},

	abstract = {Previous studies on natural resources and civil wars find that the presence of natural resources increases both civil conflict risk and duration. At the same time, belligerents often cooperate over resource extraction, suggesting a temporal variation in the contest over this subnational space. This study argues that parties fight over natural resources primarily when they expect that the conflict is about to end, as the importance of controlling them increases in the post-conflict setting. In contrast, belligerents that anticipate a long war have incentives to avoid fighting near natural resources since excessive violence will hurt the extraction, trade, and subsequent taxation that provide conflict actors with income from the resource. We test our argument using yearly and monthly grid-cell-level data on African civil conflicts for the period 1989–2008 and find support for our expected spatial variation. Using whether negotiations are underway as an indicator about warring parties’ expectations on conflict duration, we find that areas with natural resources in general experience less intense fighting than other areas, but during negotiations these very areas witness most of the violence. We further find that the spatial shift in violence occurs immediately when negotiations are opened. A series of difference-indifference estimations show a visible shift of violence towards areas rich in natural resources in the first three months after parties have initiated talks. Our findings are relevant for scholarship on understanding and predicting the trajectories of micro-level civil conflict violence, and for policymakers seeking to prevent peace processes being derailed.},

	abstract = {To help explain public sentiment about reconciliation among contemporary South Africans, two major issues are discussed. The first is how reconciliation was articulated and ‘performed’ by key leaders during the early transition. The second relates to factors shaping South Africans’ current perceptions of reconciliation. By recalling significant statements made by political leaders, and outlining the roles of the National Peace Accord and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it is shown that reconciliation was initially accepted by South Africans when it was defined as an acceptance of their interdependence, and was seen as being based on a commitment to justice and inclusivity. The post-apartheid leadership was mandated to build on these commitments in order to create a more just society over time. However, data from various public opinion surveys reveal that, despite important achievements, the government’s failure to pay reparations, combined with state corruption and denial from the white community, have created increasing disillusionment with reconciliation.},

This article examines these role effects and ﬁnds consistent patterns across both experimental and naturalistic contexts. Speciﬁcally, a “one-down effect” emerges when individuals in lower power roles assume more aggressive negotiation strategies that are signiﬁcantly less effective in achieving desired outcomes. The article concludes by identifying the theoretical frameworks that might explain these role differences.},

They attempt to frame and deﬁne changing realities in institutions that have become increasingly secular, and subjected to many of the same problems common to higher education in the public sector. External pressures, including recent efforts to strengthen the Catholic identities of these institutions, have added a measure of complexity to leadership roles and challenged the conﬂict management skills of institutional executives. The purpose of this study was to develop a proﬁle of conﬂict management behaviors of {US} Catholic college and university presidents. The proﬁle revealed four factors that were common to managing conﬂict with both faculty and trustees: avoidance, smoothing over differences, compromise, and collaboration. A bureaucratic forcing factor was linked to faculty conﬂict, and a defensive assertiveness factor emerged for conﬂict with trustees. Presidents seldom employed a bureaucratic forcing strategy with faculty, but defensive assertiveness was the second most frequently adopted strategy in conﬂict with trustees. Collaboration was the most frequently used strategy for dealing with both faculty and trustee conﬂict. Some differences in conﬂict management approaches were noted in terms of gender, lay-clergy status, years of experience, and institutional size.},

	abstract = {How does natural resource wealth influence the duration of civil conflicts? We theorize that the exploitation of natural resources can strengthen rebels’ “power to resist” the government, but this depends on how rebels earn funding from those resources. Distinguishing between the extortion and smuggling of natural resources, we posit that smuggling in particular is more likely to give rebels the flexibility and mobility needed to effectively resist government repression. We then test this proposition empirically using new data that identify not only whether rebels profit from resources but also how they do so. We find that only when rebels smuggle natural resources do civil conflicts last significantly longer. In contrast, conflicts in which rebel groups earn money from extorting natural resource production are not significantly more likely to endure. This finding is of special interest because past work has largely ignored how rebels earn income from natural resources and the implication this distinction might have on conflict processes.},

	abstract = {Conflict escalates through a series of feedback loops. On the micro level, conflict generates conditions for intense interaction rituals, and internal solidarity fuels external conflict. Perceived atrocities reciprocally increase ideological polarization between opponents, while confrontational tension/fear makes violence incompetent and produces real atrocities. Conflict groups seek allies, drive out neutrals, and mobilize material resources. Both sides in a conflict counter-escalate through the same set of feedbacks. Winning and losing are determined by differences between rates of escalation and by attacks that one-sidedly destroy organizational and material capacity. Conflict de-escalates because both sides fail to find conditions for solidarity, cannot overcome confrontational tension/fear, and exhaust their material resources. Emotional burnout sets in through a time dynamic of explosion, plateau, and dissipation of enthusiasm. Defection of allies opens the way for third-party settlement. When both sides remain stalemated, initial enthusiasm and external polarization give way to emergent internal factions—a victory faction (hard-liners) versus a peace faction (negotiators)—creating new conflict identities. Ideals promoted at the outset of conflict become obstacles to resolution at the end.},

	abstract = {Does ongoing exposure to political violence prompt subject groups to support or oppose compromise in situations of intractable conflict? If so, what is the mechanism underlying these processes? Political scholarship neither offers conclusive arguments nor sufficiently addresses individual-level forms of exposure to violence in the context of political conflict, particularly the factors mediating political outcomes. We address this by looking at the impact of exposure to political violence, psychological distress, perceived threat, and ethos of conflict on support for political compromise. A mediated model is hypothesized whereby exposure to political violence provokes support for the ethos of conflict and hinders support for compromise through perceived psychological distress and perceived national threat. We examined representative samples of two parties to the same conflict: Israelis ( N = 781) and Palestinians from Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank ( N = 1,196). The study’s main conclusion is that ethos of conflict serves as a mediating variable in the relationship between exposure to violence and attitudes toward peaceful settlement of the conflict.},

In December 2009 the Getty Conservation Institute organized, with the assistance of the Consensus Building Institute, a workshop for an invited group of practitioners to explore the application of consensus building, negotiation, and conflict resolution concepts and strategies to the management of heritage places."--Site web de l'éditeur. "These proceedings present nine papers from the workshop, including background papers concerning relevant challenges in heritage place conservation and management, and on dispute resolution and consensus building concepts and strategies, as well as case studies from diverse geographic and cultural contexts examining how practitioners dealt with a range of challenges, including in developing legislation, multi-stakeholder collaboration, dealing with places significant to indigenous communities, addressing development and tourism pressures, and working with sites of conscience. Also included are recommendations made by workshop participants, including for development of guidelines for heritage practitioners working with stakeholders, on inclusion of methods for dealing with stakeholders in heritage training and educational curricula, and for the development of related didactic materials."--Site web de l'éditeur.},

This book critically engages conflict resolution's relationship with difference while sharing the field's commitment to responsive engagement to people in conflict. Critical analysis shows that enthusiasm for conflict resolution's practical possibilities unwittingly re-inscribes dominant ways of thinking about political community, order and conflict. This denies difference and orders it on liberal terms. Yet the practical commitment to responsiveness and personal engagement on the part of many conflict resolution scholars and practitioners also offers prospects for rethinking the field's relationship with difference. When combined with critical theoretical analysis at the limits of contemporary social science, engaged practice evokes vulnerability and responsiveness to difference. Drawing upon theoretical ideas of relatedness and connection, this book moves beyond dominant ways of thinking in conflict resolution toward possibilities for responding anew across difference.},

It is argued that since Confucius and Mencius tend to conceive personal relationships in hierarchical terms, they do not directly address the goods of symmetrical friendships. Using Aristotle’s account of friendship, I argue that friendship is necessary for the cultivation of virtue outside the family. This is supported by discussing the virtues of generosity, trust, and wisdom as they develop within family life and then are refined in friendships. Lastly, as Confucius, Mencius, and Aristotle agree that the good friendship is necessarily a virtuous one, I consider what value aesthetic friendships have.},

First, three possible sources of conflicts are inventoried and their interrelations are discussed. Second, the basic mechanisms for addressing the individual sources of conflict are presented. The third part consists of a short overview of the different conflict resolution methods and procedures that can be applied to make these mechanisms operational in practice. The fourth part of the model is a discussion of the contextual factors influencing conflicts and conflict resolution, with special emphasis on cultural factors. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for the conflict resolution practice and for research.},

Cooperatives are selfgoverning organizations with democratic characters aimed at meeting the members’ needs and promoting social equity. Yet, internal organizational conflicts arise as conflicts-of-interests develop. Such conflicts can cause serious damages to the parties involved as well as harm the reputation of cooperatives as social and economic entities that tend to pursue social justice and fair distribution of income in society. This paper addresses conflict management in contemporary cooperative organizations. It is based on a preliminary research performed on factors causing conflicts in various types of cooperatives in Iran by analyzing 253 complaints made in 224 housing, consumer, transportation, producer procurement, and credit cooperatives within the central province of Tehran. It also offers some suggestions to improve conflict management within cooperative organizations.},

Writers and writings from the conflict transformation ‘school’ are surveyed and an effort is made to delineate the core characteristics of the approach, viewed either as a process or an end state. Questions are raised about transformation on a personal, group or conflict system level, all of which seem to be encompassed by various adherents of the transformation school, and the unifying concept that emerges is that of the relationship between adversaries being transformed by a variety of techniques. However, it is finally argued that the very idea of ‘relationship’ is itself ambiguous so that a real intellectual effort needs to be made to clarify its nature and characteristics, and the various ways in which relationships can be changed.},

	shorttitle = {The Political Cost?},
	abstract = {The longstanding issue of discrimination and segregation in housing markets has enveloped housing market analysis and particularly the understanding of house price determination. Whilst the relationship of segregation in residential space is diverse and encompasses numerous taxonomies, in Northern Ireland, the high level of market segregation is compounded by the addition of tactile barriers such as Peace walls. The existence of these tactile barriers serves to physically segregate communities and have the capacity to prevent the restoration of normal community interactions and market processes. This paper attempts to quantify and measure the disamenity implications and costs of these hard structures on segregated communities. It achieves this by measuring the pricing effect of peace walls within segregated market areas within the Belfast housing market employing a hedonic pricing approach using data obtained from 3,836 house sales transactions over a one year period in 2014. The findings emerging from the research demonstrate that peace walls have clearly had a more detrimental and adverse effect on the consistency and application of policy and practice. Indeed, the existence of the peace walls appear to have occasioned or facilitated differential practices in housing strategies either ‘side of the wall’. The results show a clear differential distance decay effect limiting market and efficiency opportunities.},

This article advances both a conceptual and an empirical argument to frame reconciliation and conflict transformation in these terms. First, the article draws on theories of agonistic democracy to argue for the intrinsic and potentially productive role of non-violent conflict in reconciliation efforts that accept conflict as both enduring and necessary. Second, the article contends that reconciliation is a multi-level task that requires ongoing attention and effort directed towards constitution building, institutional reform and relational transformation. The article concludes that, once conflict transformation is understood in these terms, reconciliation must be seen as a far more difficult and long-term endeavour than is usually acknowledged, requiring innovative political institutions capable of keeping open spaces for democratic political contestation.},

	abstract = {Resource-rich regions usually expect and strive for local economies to benefit from oil, gas and mineral projects. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. These regions do not always know how to take advantage of extractive activities to create sustainable economic development, be it creating jobs and developing local businesses or building skills and improving technologies. Local content is the processes of building such economic capital at the national and subnational level, and meeting set public policy objectives. National and regional governments need to consider a broader range of fiscal and economic policy issues to fully embrace the opportunities the oil, gas and mining sectors can offer. When considering these options, governments sometimes make tradeoffs to maximize the benefits for their countries. Trade-offs made during negotiations between companies and governments may include the level and type of tax concessions offered to companies, the level of royalties companies need to pay, and targets such as the level of local content and social investment commitments sought. These trade-offs are typically specific to project, country and, in some cases, region. Governments also consider how the money flows from the national to the subnational level and the role different levels of government play in securing local benefits. Ultimately, the driver of policy choices is a country’s unique and complex web of social, economic and political issues.},

The goals pursued by mobilized ethnic communities include domination, secession, integration, power-sharing and minority rights, each of which is implemented by state-sanctioned policies and practices. Recent experience with civil and military bureaucracies in India and South Africa, two highly pluralistic and con¯ict-prone societies, suggests that ethnically representative bureaucracy, though by no means trouble-free, contributes to the legitimacy of government by demonstrating that members of all ethnic communities can and actually do participate in the administration of public aairs.

	abstract = {"Beginning with the foundations of community development, this book offers a comprehensive and practical approach to planning for communities. Road-tested in the authors' own teaching, and also through the training they provide for practising planners, it enables students to begin making connections between academic study and practical know-how from both private and public sector contexts. An Introduction to Community Development shows how planners can utilise local economic interests and integrate finance and marketing considerations into their strategy. Most importantly, the book is strongly focused on outcomes, encouraging students to ask: what is best practice when it comes to planning for communities, and how do we accurately measure the results of planning practice? Each chapter provides a range of reading materials for the student, supplemented with text boxes, a chapter outline, keywords, and reference lists, making this the most user-friendly text now available."--{BOOK} {JACKET}},

It includes chapters on repeated games, social choice theory, and selected topics such as bargaining theory, exchange economies, and matching. Part {II} goes deeper into noncooperative theory and treats the theory of zerosum games, refinements of Nash equilibrium in strategic as well as extensive form games, and evolutionary games. Part {III} covers basic concepts in the theory of transferable utility games, such as core and balancedness, Shapley value and variations, and nucleolus. Some mathematical tools on duality and convexity are collected in Part {IV}. Every chapter in the book concludes with a problem section. Hints, answers and solutions are included},

I explore the benefits of {MMR} for understanding structures, agency, and processes related to violence and conflict, and the opportunity {MMR} offers to influence a broader academic and policy audience. {MMR} can improve the accordance of theories and empirical studies with the complexities of social reality and enhance understanding of the causes, consequences, and potential remedies of violence and conflict.},

As we know across the globe countries are facing number of conflicts, social, economic, political, ethnic and other types of conflicts are prevalent which needs a solution only then people can live a peaceful life without any fear and danger. Conflict resolution is such a mechanism where conflicted parties come together and sort-out their incompatibilities and conflicts by peaceful means. It has been accepted by all stalwarts, academicians, civil society and prominent personalities of the world that war is the last option in politics which can only be interpreted as last resort. Conflict resolution as mechanism of peace building, peacemaking and peacekeeping includes only peaceful methods and techniques for the maintenance of peace and security and to protect the succeeding generations from the scourge of war, because war has the bad repercussions and ramifications. Today in renowned universities of the world conflict resolution is being studied as subject of discipline. Hence, conflict resolution can play a vital role to create awareness among people of the world that only in peaceful world people can survive and develop themselves. World had seen the consequences of first and second world war now they don’t want to see another war which would be more dangerous in terms of disaster, and annihilations, the world have not so much resources to overcome its debt. Therefore, conflict resolution mechanism and confidence building measures can be adopted as a check or prevention over conflicts and peace could be maintained in easy way without following the way of violence.},

	title = {A Systematic Literature Review of Software Defect Prediction: Research Trends, Datasets, Methods and Frameworks},
	volume = {1},
	abstract = {Recent studies of software defect prediction typically produce datasets, methods and frameworks which allow software engineers to focus on development activities in terms of defect-prone code, thereby improving software quality and making better use of resources. Many software defect prediction datasets, methods and frameworks are published disparate and complex, thus a comprehensive picture of the current state of defect prediction research that exists is missing. This literature review aims to identify and analyze the research trends, datasets, methods and frameworks used in software defect prediction research betweeen 2000 and 2013. Based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 71 software defect prediction studies published between January 2000 and December 2013 were remained and selected to be investigated further. This literature review has been undertaken as a systematic literature review. Systematic literature review is defined as a process of identifying, assessing, and interpreting all available research evidence with the purpose to provide answers for specific research questions. Analysis of the selected primary studies revealed that current software defect prediction research focuses on five topics and trends: estimation, association, classification, clustering and dataset analysis. The total distribution of defect prediction methods is as follows. 77.46\% of the research studies are related to classification methods, 14.08\% of the studies focused on estimation methods, and 1.41\% of the studies concerned on clustering and association methods. In addition, 64.79\% of the research studies used public datasets and 35.21\% of the research studies used private datasets. Nineteen different methods have been applied to predict software defects. From the nineteen methods, seven most applied methods in software defect prediction are identified. Researchers proposed some techniques for improving the accuracy of machine learning classifier for software defect prediction by ensembling some machine learning methods, by using boosting algorithm, by adding feature selection and by using parameter optimization for some classifiers. The results of this research also identified three frameworks that are highly cited and therefore influential in the software defect prediction field. They are Menzies et al. Framework, Lessmann et al. Framework, and Song et al. Framework.},

	abstract = {Few studies exist about the extent to which co-management in protected areas contributes to conflict prevention or mitigation and at what level of the conflicts such collaborative efforts are possible. Following varying degrees of conflict, Mole National Park, Ghana, embarked on a collaborative community-based wildlife management programme in . Using Glasl’s conflict escalation model, we analysed the contribution of co-management to mitigating and preventing conflicts from escalating. We conducted a total of  interviews with local traditional leaders, Park officials and local government officials, and  focus group discussions with farmers, hunters, women and representatives of co-management boards, selected from  of the  communities surrounding the Park. Our findings indicate that co-management can help mitigate or prevent conflicts from escalating when conflicting parties engage with each other in a transparent manner using deliberative processes such as negotiation, mediation and the use of economic incentives. It is, however, difficult to resolve conflicts through co-management when dialogue between conflicting parties breaks down, as parties take entrenched positions and are unwilling to compromise on their core values and interests. We conclude that although co-management contributes to successful conflict management, factors such as understanding the context of the conflicts, including the underlying sources and manifestations of the conflict, incorporating local knowledge, and ensuring open dialogue, trust and transparency between conflicting parties are key to attaining sustainable conflict management in protected areas.},

This new publication is a two-volume set that explores ways in which democratic practice can contribute to the management of contemporary conflicts and promote the realization of security and development objectives. Volume I contains analysis and recommendations based on wide-ranging research and evaluation of lessons learned from democratization processes, past and ongoing. Volume {II} presents essays and case studies by leading specialists from around the world that further develop the themes and findings presented in Volume I. Democracy, Conflict and Human Security argues that effective democracy building moves beyond the process of elections and technical assistance and examines how democratic practice relates to human security. Governments may hold free elections but fall short in other democratic measures such as the separation of powers, the freedom of the press, and guarantees of human rights. These two volumes are aimed at practitioners, parliamentarians, politicians, government officials and policy makers concerned with problems such as social exclusion, the quality of democracy and new forms of authoritarian regimes.},

	abstract = {Halal tourism is one of the new phenomenon emerged from the growth of Halal industry. As Halal matters advancing tourism industry, many Muslim and non-Muslim countries are set to capture the Muslim tourists market by providing the tourism products, facilities and infrastructures to cater their needs. While afﬁrming this new phenomenon, there remain a shortage of theoretical publications and research in this area. On top of that, when it comes to the real concept of Halal tourism and its trends, it has nevertheless been found that lack of research has been conducted in providing and determining the so called concept. Thus, due to the scarcity of literature and speciﬁc studies in this area this paper aims to explore and illustrate the concept of Halal tourism within the Islamic context with special reference to Quranic verse and Hadith (primary sources in Islam). Meanwhile, to appreciate the existing implementation on this concept, this paper will further provide cases on current trend of Halal tourism in selected countries in Asia. This study adopted qualitative research method and employ library research for data collection technique. The outcomes of this study include the current development of Halal tourism concept and comparison on Halal tourism cases in Asia. On top of that, it would also discover its opportunities and potentials for Muslim and non-Muslim countries to embark on the same journey. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results from various research conducted in Turkey suggest that violence, aggression, and bullying behaviors are still rampant in the primary and high schools. Studies conducted in primary and middle schools toward decreasing aggression and preventing violence focus on programs such as violence prevention, conflict resolution, and peer mediation. While these programs are mainly based on peacemaking strategy, prevention programs based on positive peace and peacebuilding strategy with tested effectiveness are rather limited. Thus, a peace education program based on positive peace and peacebuilding strategy was developed and its effects on aggression levels of sixth grade students were investigated.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches of food security largely draw from neoliberal prescriptions, which focus on supply side issues of improving productivity and efficiency through market mechanisms. Reflections on the oral accounts of 30 migrants from eastern India to the capital city of Gujarat, India, provide two important insights regarding food security related issues. First, in terms of the lived realities of these migrants, traditional approaches of food security are inadequate to address their concerns as they exacerbate their food related vulnerabilities. Second, economic democracy and food sovereignty approaches are more helpful in addressing food related vulnerabilities as these approaches engage more comprehensively with the multidimensional socioeconomic vulnerabilities of the migrants from the perspective of equity and justice.},

This distinction is important because understanding general deterrence is more important than understanding immediate deterrence, and because empirical analyses of immediate deterrence can be misleading due to selection effects. In a series of formal and quantitative analyses, the author tests perfect deterrence theory, applies the theory to explain recurrent conflict, and develops a new three-party game of extended deterrence."--Résumé de l'éditeur},

Firm innovativeness is critical for organizational survival. Yet, the authors’ understanding about the key determinants of firm innovativeness is limited, particularly concerning the role of {TMT} dynamics. Drawing on upper echelon’s theory, the authors develop and test hypotheses concerning the influence of two {TMT} processes, namely affective conflict and cognitive conflict, on firm innovativeness. They also explore the boundary conditions of {TMT} dynamics by examining the moderating effect of environmental uncertainty on the relationship between {TMT} conflict (affective and cognitive conflict) and firm innovativeness.},

In addition, there is a vast area of economic games, discussed in Myerson (1991) and Kreps (1990), and the related political games [Ordeshook (1986), Shubik (1982), and Taylor (1995)]. The competition between firms, the conflict between management and labor, the fight to get bills through congress, the power of the judiciary, war and peace negotiations between countries, and so on, all provide examples of games in action. There are also psychological games played on a personal level, where the weapons are words, and the payoffs are good or bad feelings [Berne (1964)]. There are biological games, the competition between species, where natural selection can be modeled as a game played between genes [Smith (1982)]. There is a connection between game theory and the mathematical areas of logic and computer science. One may view theoretical statistics as a two-person game in which nature takes the role of one of the players, as in Blackwell and Girshick (1954) and Ferguson (1968). Games are characterized by a number of players or decision makers who interact, possibly threaten each other and form coalitions, take actions under uncertain conditions, and finally receive some benefit or reward or possibly some punishment or monetary loss. In this text, we present various mathematical models of games and study the phenomena that arise. In some cases, we will be able to suggest what courses of action should be taken by the players. In others, we hope simply to be able to understand what is happening in order to make better predictions about the future"--},

Crucial Conversations offers readers a proven seven-point strategy for achieving their goals in all those emotionally, psychologically, or legally charged situations that can arise in their professional and personal lives. Based on the authors' highly popular {DialogueSmart} training seminars, the techniques are geared toward getting people to lower their defenses, creating mutual respect and understanding, increasing emotional safety, and encouraging freedom of expression. Among other things, readers also learn about the four main factors that characterize crucial conversations, and they get a powerful six-minute mastery technique that prepares them to work through any high impact situation with confidence.},

	abstract = {In recent years game theory has swept through all of the social sciences. Its practitioners have great designs for it, claiming that it offers an opportunity to unify the social sciences and that it it the natural foundation of a rational theory of society. Game Theory is for those who are intrigued but baffled by these claims, and daunted by the technical demands of most introductions to the subject. Requiring no more than simple arithmetic, the book: * Traces the origins of Game Theory and its philosophical premises * Looks at its implications for the theory of bargaining and social contract theory * Gives a detailed exposition of all of the major g̀ames' including the famous p̀risoner's dilemma' * Analyses cooperative, non cooperative, repeated, evolutionary and experimental games.},

The {CPR} unit has developed a Conflict Analysis Framework ({CAF}) to help Bank teams consider factors affecting conflict when contributing to strategies, policies, and programs. Conflict sensitive approaches that take account of problem areas and potential sources of conflict may help to prevent the onset, exacerbation, or resurgence of violent conflict. Working through {CAF} would help a team identify and analyze the key factors that impact conflict and their links with poverty, to determine how they best can be addressed through Bank assistance. A first step for a team is to ascertain whether or not a country should undertake conflict analysis, and for this purpose a risk screening process, which consists of nine indicators, is developed. If a team determines that conflict analysis is necessary, it moves to the second stage — conducting conflict analysis with {CAF}. {CAF} is composed of six categories of variables covering factors that have shown to affect or be affected by conflict, and teams would consider the linkages of these variables to both conflict and poverty for a country. In the future, {CAF} will also include guidelines for conflict impact assessments to help anticipate the potential impact (ex ante), and assess the effects (ex post) of Bank assisted strategies or programs on conflict.},

Written by one of the founders of the professional conflict management field and co-published with the American Bar Association, this book outlines the seven major dilemmas that conflict resolution practitioners face every day. Readers will find expert guidance toward getting to the heart of conflict, along with practical tools and techniques for more successful intervention. Using stories, experiences, and reflective exercises to bring these concepts to life, the author provides actionable advice for resolving disputes.Even contradictions that initially seem insurmountable can be overcome. The key is to help disputants change their approach to the seven dilemmas; instead of just seeing each as a duality where one must choose sides, they need to accept them as paradoxes in order to reach agreement. The Conflict Paradox provides a framework with which to analyze conflict and pinpoint the true issues being faced in order to facilitate the implementation of the best possible solution. Examine the contradictions at the center of almost all conflicts Explore the seven dilemmas: Competition and Cooperation; Optimism and Realism; Avoidance and Engagement; Principle and Compromise; Emotions and Logic; Impartiality and Advocacy; Autonomy and Community Understand that the sides of each paradox are interdependent, and learn how to move forward with that knowledge Discover the tools and techniques that make conflicts less of a hurdle to overcome Conflict is everywhere, and conflict resolution skills are valuable far beyond the professional and legal realms. With insight and creativity, solutions are almost always possible. For conflict resolution professionals looking for a better conflict analysis framework, The Conflict Paradox provides a roadmap to resolution"--},

This article argues that quantitative peace research could be improved if authors put more emphasis on the substantive issues and less on the mechanical application of rule-based, statistical techniques. After some methodological discussion, seven questions are posed that quantitative researchers might ask themselves; an attempt is made to show why these questions are important. If quantitative peace researchers asked themselves these questions more often, the substantive contribution of quantitative peace research could be increased.},

And quite frankly, there are few, if any, mechanisms worldwide relevant to staving off a future Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and the like (see Lund, 1996): witness the unfolding of the violent Albanian-Serbian conflict in Kosovo into a possible, wider Balkan war (see, e.g., Nordland and Watson, 1998; Finn, 1999; Dinmore, 1999a, 1999b)!},

	abstract = {The argument that social or international conflicts are functional or dysfunctional is re- examined. It is suggested that discussion has tended to confuse at least three levels at which any conflict could realistically and usefully be evaluated; that of the parties engaged in the conflict, that of factions and individuals within each of the parties, and that of the overall social system within which the conflict occurs. Various kinds of costs and benefits of engaging and then succeeding in a conflict are considered, ranging from economic or political to psychological, including costs and benefits that are deferred to some future time. The point of view that sees conflicts as simply functional or dysfunctional is criticised and instead it is suggested that these terms be seen as an invitation to carry out some form of cost calculation, bearing in mind key considerations of 'Functional for whom and over what time period?' Finally, it is argued that any efforts to resolve (or even merely to settle) the conflict should take account of benefits some may achieve by active participation and role playing, so any solution should find some compensation for such foregone benefits. Illustrations are drawn from the settlement ending the civil war in the Sudan.},

	abstract = {Albert Bandura is the most cited living psychologist, and is regularly named as one of the most influential figures ever to have worked in his field. Much of his reputation stems from the theories and experiments described in his 1973 study Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis -- a book that is both a classic of psychological study and a masterclass in the analytical skills central to good critical thinking. Bandura's central contention is that much human learning is fundamentally social. As children imitate the behavior of those around them, and as their behaviors are reinforced by modelling, they entrench cognitive functions that more or less become part of their core personalities. The experiments that Bandura designed in order to prove his contentions with regard to learned aggressive tendencies show the powers of critical thinking analysis and evaluation at their best. Having set up a play environment for children in which they could be exposed to aggressive behavior (inflicted on a bobo doll), he was able to systematically examine their responses and learned behaviors, working out their functions and understanding the relationships between different aspects of behavior that combined to form a whole. Carefully evaluating at each stage the different extent to which children's own aggressive behavior was affected by and modelled on what they saw. Bandura produced results that revolutionized psychology's whole approach to human learning and behavior."--Provided by publisher},

Governments and other national agencies have argued that this promotes efficiency, equity, and other wide national goals. Recently this orthodoxy has been challenged by rising numbers of experiments that show how centralised management tends to fail. Global, national and local goals are more likely to be met, at lower cost and with other benefits (such as promoting better democratic institutions) by involving local populations in collaborative management agreements. This volume, based on detailed case studies from around the world, subjects some of these experiments to critical study, and suggests limits to the participative approach as well as ways it can be improved and made suitable for new contexts.},

	abstract = {Territorial disputes have defined modern politics, but political theorists and philosophers have said little about how to resolve such disputes fairly. Is it even possible to do so? If historical attachments or divine promises are decisive, it may not be. More significant than these largely subjective claims are the ways in which people interact with land over time. Building from this insight, Avery Kolers evaluates existing political theories and develops an attractive alternative. He presents a novel link between political legitimacy and environmental stewardship, and applies these ideas in an extended and balanced discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The result is the first systematic normative theory of territory, and an impressive example of applied philosophy. In addition to political theorists and philosophers, scholars and students of sociology, international relations, and human geography will find this book rewarding, as will anyone with wider interests in territory and justice.},

	abstract = {"This book explains why international post-conflict interventions have fallen short of the weighty aspirations they embody. It reframes the peacebuilding puzzle by presenting a new theory of how domestic elites construct political order during and after peacebuilding interventions. A comparative analysis of the {UN}'s transformative peacebuilding attempts in Cambodia, East Timor, and Afghanistan shows that while international peacebuilders want to build effective and legitimate government, domestic elites essentially do not. As is the case in much of the developing world, post-conflict elites use strategies to prioritize their own political survival and power that result in a neopatrimonial political order that better delivers on their goals. Peacebuilding interventions thus generate a set of unintended yet predictable effects. In all three cases, the {UN}'s efforts at peacebuilding through elite settlement followed by a process of simultaneous statebuilding and democratization were co-opted by a small subset of domestic power-holders who successfully closed down the political space and stunted state capacity. To be sure, each of these countries is better off than before the peace operations. Yet the goals of intervention have not truly been met. Instead, there are striking similarities in the patterns of neopatrimonial order that emerge in the aftermath of intervention. This book makes the case that the peacebuilding approach is, at least in part, itself responsible for the eventually disappointing governance outcomes that emerge in post-conflict countries"--},

In contrast, this volume breaches those boundaries; though each author is grounded in a particular discipline, the chapters have been written in a spirit of interdisciplinarity.The focus of the volume is how the violence of conflict is transformed in the post-conflict period into processes that the editors have categorised as criminalisation, medicalisation and missionisation. Comprised of essays written by a diverse group of scholars and activists from anthropology, political science, international relations, law, education, religion, and military history, each section of the book looks at the concept of post-conflict in a way that problematises its common usage and highlights the importance of strongly interdisciplinary research into post-conflict societies.This book will be of interest to students of war and conflict studies, peace studies, security studies and {IR} in general"--},

The era in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War was, paradoxically, a time of great optimism in parts of academia. There was, especially in the United States and much of Europe, a widespread belief in the social sciences that systematic scholarly analysis would enable humanity to understand and do something about the most complex of social processes and thus about solving persistent human problems: unemployment, delinquency, racism, under-development, and even issues of conflict, war and peace. This book examines the evolution of the Basic Human Needs theory and is divided into two key parts: Basic Human Needs in Theory and Basic Human Needs in Practice.

	abstract = {In an extensive analysis of negotiation behavior, advantages and disadvantages of making concessions are presented and various methods of indirect communication, tacit communication, informal conferences, and use of intermediates and mediators are discussed. Indirect communication can be used to coordinate specific exchanges and to indicate general attitudes of threat or flexibility while avoiding the position loss or image loss associated with more direct negotiation. Tacit communication is particularly useful in sequential negotiation where the signaler indicates willingness to make concessions on early items in exchange for a counterconcession later. This form of indirect communication appears to depend on a norm of "truth in signalling" which becomes less applicable as the signal becomes more ambiguous. Informal conferences are those private meetings between negotiators where frank presentation of flexibilities is the usual rule. Norms governing these exchanges include secrecy, removal of the necessity to honor concessions not reciprocated, and a requirement that agreements reached be carried over into formal negotiations. Intermediates (usually contacted by the side wanting the message sent) and mediators (called into the negotiation by both sides) can also be used to transmit messages. Finally, sets of hypotheses derived from this analysis are presented. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Findings show that diversity shapes conflict and that conflict, in turn, shapes performance, but these linkages have subtleties. Functional background diversity drives task conflict, but multiple types of diversity drive emotional conflict. Race and tenure diversity are positively associated with emotional conflict, while age diversity is negatively associated with such conflict. Task routineness and group longevity moderate these relationships. Results further show that task conflict has more favorable effects on cognitive task performance than does emotional conflict. Overall, these patterns suggest a complex link between work group diversity and work group functioning.},

These visualization options not only look attractive but also can increase transparency about the distribution of the underlying data rather than relying on commonly used visualizations of aggregations, such as bar charts of means. In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualization using R specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First, we detail the rationale for using R for data visualization and introduce the “grammar of graphics” that underlies data visualization using the ggplot package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software, such as histograms and box plots, and shows how the code for these “basic” plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options, such as violin box plots. The data set and code used in this tutorial and an interactive version with activity solutions, additional resources, and advanced plotting options are available at https://osf.io/bj83f/ .},

	abstract = {A pie chart is a common way of presenting simple statistics—for example, the amount of time devoted to teaching, researching, and administration by the faculty can be illustrated by dividing a circle (‘pie’) into three appropriately sized segments. There has been much discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of such pie charts for a long time, and it is not likely to end soon. 3D pie charts show the same statistics, but in three dimensions. Multiple pie charts can be found where the data for groups to be compared are presented in adjacent pies. Here we argue that, even if a simple pie chart may have some advantages, the same cannot be said for multiple pie charts. Multiple pie charts are difficult to analyze and interpret, especially when comparing adjacent pies.},

	abstract = {This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and {RStudio}. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: - produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification - superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales - add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression - save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse - create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots - approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless} - Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system - New scales, stats and geoms added throughout - Additional practice exercises - A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() - Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

For example, industrial conflict (employer vs. employed) can appear under any of the abstract types, since either party can be a person, group, or organization (Boulding, 1962, p. 213). International conflict can fall under either homogeneous or heterogeneous organization conflict, depending on whether the parties (which may be tribes, feudal states, universal agricultural empires, industrial powers, or superpowers) are equal, unequal, or hopelessly unequal (pp. 227-229). The conflict of ideological systems is partly ecological, partly organizational (p. 278). In Boulding’s view, these empirical types (which do not represent an exhaustive list) are different enough from each other to require separate treatment. Whether this dual classification implies 8 -f4 special theories, 8 X 4 special theories, or some intermediate or larger number, is not at all clear. The mode of abstraction represented in Boulding’s eight-type scheme has been carried a step further. One need only distinguish two types of parties-individuals vs. collective entities (e.g., Sorokin’s distinction between persons and groups). Similarly, the structural relations between parties can be reduced to a simple dichotomy : either the conflicting parties are members of a larger system or else they are separate, autonomous entities which happen to interact in a common environment. This latter distinction has appeared (under various labels) in many schemes: distinctions such as those between intragroup and intergroup conflict (Simmel, 1955; Coser, 1956), intraparty and interparty conflict (Mack and Snyder, 1957), conflict within a social unit and conflict between social units (Levinger, 1957), or internal conflict (\&dquo;quandaries\&dquo;) and conflicts between parties (Boulding, 1957), all reflect the same basic dichotomy. By combining these two basic dichotomies, one arrives at a simple classification containing four types of conflict, as illustrated by Galtung (1965b, p. 348), who presents the following table: By ignoring the differences among concrete types which could appear in the bottom row, this table implies a smaller number of special theories than any scheme so far discussed. Galtung’s four-cell scheme is not merely a condensation of Boulding’s eight abstract types, but rather a partial condensation combined with the addition of new types. On one axis (nature of parties), Galtung has simply ignored Boulding’s distinction between groups and organizations, replacing these with a single category, i.e., \&dquo;collectivities.\&dquo; Furthermore, he ignores the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous pairs of parties. The result is that one of Boulding’s types of conflict (interpersonal) is retained in Galtung’s scheme, while the remaining seven types are apparently subsumed under a single category (intersystem, collective level). Thus Galtung’s scheme reduces Boulding’s eight types to only two by ignoring certain distinctions. On the other axis (structural relations between parties), Galtung introduces new types by attending to an aspect (intrasystem vs. intersystem) which is at best only implicit in Boulding’s scheme. Thus intrapersonal conflict is not one of Boulding’s eight types (even though he does discuss intrapersonal conflict as a factor which influences the behavior of indi-},

              This paper aims to investigate the definition of conflict, and argue that conflict is not always destructive.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This commentary centers on re‐evaluating past research into the definition and nature of conflict. It proposes that more thought is required when using the term as it is too broad in its definition. The term has become synonymous with negativity, and this commentary aims to show that the term may also be used in certain situations when conflict can have a positive effect.
            
            
              Findings
              Although the research has shown that some people have a broader idea of what the term “conflict” comprises, the majority of people use the common definition related to destruction and negativity.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Opens up a discussion revolving around the concept of conflict and dispels the commonly held definition that conflict is always detrimental.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper takes an alternative view of conflict and opens up the little‐held discussion around the term itself and its negative connotations.},

Major domain-limited theories of aggression include cognitive neoassociation, social learning, social interaction, script, and excitation transfer theories. Using the general aggression model ({GAM}), this review posits cognition, affect, and arousal to mediate the effects of situational and personological variables on aggression. The review also organizes recent theories of the development and persistence of aggressive personality. Personality is conceptualized as a set of stable knowledge structures that individuals use to interpret events in their social world and to guide their behavior. In addition to organizing what is already known about human aggression, this review, using the {GAM} framework, also serves the heuristic function of suggesting what research is needed to fill in theoretical gaps and can be used to create and test interventions for reducing aggression.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to evaluate various methods of resolving conflict among construction professionals ({CPs}) in Nigeria. A quantitative research technique was utilised. This study used well-structured questionnaires which were forwarded to numerous {CPs} in the Southwest of Nigeria. A total of 150 questionnaires were sent out and 135 were received back from respondents. The research revealed some major approaches to conflict resolution among the {CPs}, such as collaborating, accommodating, negotiating, compromising, mediating, arbitrating, mediating-arbitrating, contending, obliging, early neutral evaluation and avoiding. This study is limited to construction professionals ({CPs}) that are members of Nigerian professional bodies and just 135 respondents took part in the survey. This study recommends that further studies should use other analysis methods to assess conflict resolution techniques among the {CPs}. The results from this study will enhance the knowledge of {CPs} in Nigeria of numerous methods of resolving conflict. Furthermore, the outcomes will help {CPs} make use of collaborating and accommodating in settling conflict within their individual professional bodies. Previous studies on conflict resolution methods only concentrated on contractors and consultants in construction projects but this present study contributes to the body of knowledge by assessing conflict resolution methods among {CPs} within their individual professional bodies. Additionally, the exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) utilised in this study is novel since previous studies have not employed this analysis method. Therefore, it is recommended that {CPs} should be collaborating with one another in order to solidify their relationship and enhance their performance within their professional bodies.},

David Creswell, continues the pioneering tradition of providing clear and concise instruction for understanding research and developing proposals for all three approaches. This classic text walks students through research methods, starting with a preliminary consideration of philosophical assumptions, continuing with a review of the literature, an assessment of the use of theory in research approaches, and ending with reflections about the importance of writing and ethics in scholarly inquiry in a way that is applicable to all types of research. Coverage of key elements of the research process helps readers organize and develop their research project, giving specific attention to each methodological approach. The book has been lauded for its language and tone, which are both accessible and inviting. Students keep and continue to use this text as a resource throughout their studies, once the specific class is over. The Sixth Edition includes more coverage of community-based participatory research, comparisons of qualitative and quantitative research, an expanded glossary with basic terms, updated examples of social, behavioral, and health research, new coverage of ethical requirements, updated {APA} 7th edition coverage, and additional exercises aimed at research projects"--},

              – This paper aims to provide a framework for thinking about meaningful data visualization in ways that can be applied to routine statistics collected by libraries.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – An overview of common data display methods is provided, with an emphasis on tables, scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, histograms, pie charts and infographics. Research on “best practices” in data visualization design is presented; also provided is a comparison of free online data visualization tools.
            
            
              Findings
              – Different data display methods are best suited for different quantitative relationships. There are rules to follow for optimal data visualization design. Ten free online data visualization tools are recommended by the authors.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – Evidence-based libraries collect and use data to affect change and to support departmental and institutional accreditation standards. Proper data visualization allows libraries to communicate their message in a more compelling and interesting way, while assisting in the understanding of complex data.},

Charles Tilly (2007) examined democratic regression from democracy and de-democratization theory through the concept of low-capacity democracy. Tilly's perspective argues a low-capacity democratic process occurred during the Joko Widodo administration in Indonesia from 2014 to 2020 when the state implemented the Police as a political instrument to maintain power. As a result, the character of the Police deviated from democratic principles, leading to a problem for police professionalism. The study employs qualitative methods, in which the primary data is obtained from in-depth interviews with several key informants. The secondary data is gathered from scientific works of literature and news in online media. This study indicates how low-capacity democracy developed through: first, the Indonesian regime's intervention and exercise of control by involving and appointing police officers to civilian positions; second, police repression against civil liberties; and third, the Police's justification for their authority and power. Thus, this study confirms Tilly's argument that a low-capacity democratic process occurs when democratic countries pursue undemocratic methods by manipulating the Police as an instrument to strengthen the power of the regime. The recommendation of this study is to strengthen democracy in terms of law enforcement by the supervision of parliament and supervisory institutions to retain the Police’s role as an independent law enforcement institution.},

The second approach puts into conflict a contradiction, in connection with which it is the result of its aggravation and actualization. In the third approach, conflict is a type of structural imbalance and is characterized by the impossibility of a system or social relations remaining in the same form. Another approach at the heart of the conflict addresses social tensions of dual significance. The structure of the conflict itself (the object, the subjects of the conflict, etc.), as well as the content of its constituent elements, are studied in detail. Dismantled and disclosed the environment in which the conflict takes place. In general, the article is of an overview nature and can be useful as a theoretical and methodological basis for the study of conflict in various organizations, institutions, etc.},

Even when multiple event data sets are available, researchers tend to rely on only one. We instead advocate integrating information from multiple event data sets. The advantages include facilitating analysis of relationships between different types of conflict, providing more comprehensive empirical measurement, and evaluating the relative coverage and quality of data sets. Existing integration efforts have been performed manually, with significant limitations. Therefore, we introduce Matching Event Data by Location, Time and Type ({MELTT})—an automated, transparent, reproducible methodology for integrating event data sets. For the cases of Nigeria 2011, South Sudan 2015, and Libya 2014, we show that using {MELTT} to integrate data from four leading conflict event data sets (Uppsala Conflict Data Project–Georeferenced Event Data, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, Social Conflict Analysis Database, and Global Terrorism Database) provides a more complete picture of conflict. We also apply multiple systems estimation to show that each of these data sets has substantial missingness in coverage.},

Because we care about these matters, we try to advance procedures and theories about systematizing our observations and improving our skills of analysis. Recent developments in international relations have tended to (a) emphasize the exploration of more specific problems and testing of hypotheses with quantified data and (b) deemphasized the search for general theories of internation behavior. This trend appears to be undergoing slight modification for many reasons. Events contain useful information which permit a student of foreign policy to use events singularly or in the aggregate to study foreign policy outputs and inputs. A student of international systems uses events singularly or in the aggregate to study patterns, structures, and transformation. This research calls for continuously developing models and operational procedures which analyze these phenomena with faster and better numerical precision. The Conflict and Peace Data Bank Project is the contribution of myself, my students, and my colleagues to this effort.},

The disturbances began in Sampit City and spread to Kuala Kapuas, Pangkalan Bun and Palangka Raya.

It aims to provide solutions for political parties in the election nomination. It reveals conflict in the preparation of candidates in the elections of 2019. Researchers collect data from political party information and media coverage by comparing news. The method is qualitative with analysis using Paul Conn's conflict structure theory to produce alternative solutions. The results is a difference in expectations and designs between political party leaders and incumbent legislators, according to political party leaders that legislative incumbents need to have an evaluation so they are displaced from candidates for those who were not optimally fighting for political parties, different perspectives of incumbent legislators because they feel have struggled be serious and prepare for second (more) contestation. The legislative incumbent who should be eligible to advance back from the same electoral district then tries to find a new path by advancing again as a legislative candidate by using other political parties. The Conclusion is shifting legislative candidates and changes in the acquisition of election results show the dynamics of political party conflict affect the outcome.},

	abstract = {Conflict in the Indonesian state cannot be separated from the influence of politics and religious understanding. The symbolization of religion and politics became part of the conflicts that were often faced. This influence is due to the existence of political forces that deliberately put religion as a tool of movement. Where religion, which is a transcendental form of human beings, becomes very political for the sake of economic interests. Muslim societies are trying to reform the society or the community in which the state survives. In addition, the elite sought to reform the country. This idea tries to interpret the Islamization of Java as an alternative conflict and accommodation between competing identities between Java and Islam. This paper uses a qualitative approach by strengthening literature reviews sourced from existing realities. The results found that the politicization of religion prioritizes its main political aspects and uses religion as a tool to create conflict. This happens because religion is one of the ways to create conflicts both vertically and horizontally. Therefore, in minimizing conflicts, Pancasila ideology is needed as a mediator and conflict resolution.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} – The conventional threats now have been shifted into unconventional threats which is now considered as one of the biggest threats for Indonesia. Proxy war is an unconventional threat and it is happening now in Indonesia through internal conflicts. The number of internal conflicts, whether vertical and horizontal, have increased significantly since the Reformation era started, and it is believed there is a third party who has a role on that. Many countries prefer proxy war due to its efficiency reasons and it creates a great result of destruction. It is not easy for the government to forecast whether the conflicts are naturally emerged or designed by third parties. Security apparatus, therefore, must design a conflict mapping in every non-military sector. The mapping will lead us in exploring all parties who have a connection to conflicts. It must be realized that internal conflicts are influenced by many factors such as ideology, politics, economics, and social, which later will continue to proxy war threats. Proxy war, therefore, will always be chosen due to its efficiency because they will not use their own resources.

In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualization using R specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First, we detail the rationale for using R for data visualization and introduce the “grammar of graphics” that underlies data visualization using the ggplot package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software, such as histograms and box plots, and shows how the code for these “basic” plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options, such as violin box plots.

            The R programming language and computing environment is a powerful and common platform used by life science researchers and educators for the analysis of big data. One of the benefits of using R in this context is its ability to visualize the results. Using R to generate visualizations has gained in popularity due to the increased number of R packages available to convert data to graphic display. In this paper, I ask the following question: how can student engagement with protein analysis be promoted using R‐based visualizations in the classroom? During the 2021 {IUBMB}/{ASBMD} workshop “Teaching Science with Big Data”, I presented a teaching strategy that used R for the visualization of protein data. In this report, I provide a teaching procedure and a summary of how students engaged with these data in our Introduction to R for Professional Data Science class. This report is based on a case study methodology by reviewing student peer comments for protein analyses conducted in R. The results indicated that students were active participants in the peer‐review process and that they learned to take a critical view of data visualization.},

Therefore, here we highlight the benefits of R, an open-source programming language, for scientific data visualization, with a specific focus on creating dynamic, interactive figures using the R shiny package. For R users, we have included a tutorial with example code to create three increasingly complex shiny applications. For individuals more interested in understanding the potential of R shiny as an innovative tool to interact with research data, we have included links to online versions of the examples that do not require any programming or R experience. We believe that widespread adoption of dynamic and interactive scientific data visualization will further support nurse scientists’ higher-level mission of advancing our understanding of health and wellness of individuals and communities.},

            Many visual analytics systems allow users to interact with machine learning models towards the goals of data exploration and insight generation on a given dataset. However, in some situations, insights may be less important than the production of an accurate predictive model for future use. In that case, users are more interested in generating of diverse and robust predictive models, verifying their performance on holdout data, and selecting the most suitable model for their usage scenario. In this paper, we consider the concept of Exploratory Model Analysis ({EMA}), which is defined as the process of discovering and selecting relevant models that can be used to make predictions on a data source. We delineate the differences between {EMA} and the well‐known term exploratory data analysis in terms of the desired outcome of the analytic process: insights into the data or a set of deployable models. The contributions of this work are a visual analytics system workflow for {EMA}, a user study, and two use cases validating the effectiveness of the workflow. We found that our system workflow enabled users to generate complex models, to assess them for various qualities, and to select the most relevant model for their task.},

	abstract = {{EDA} is a process of tidying, processing and analyzing acquired data sets. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines scientific methods, systems, and processes from statistics, information science, and computer science to provide insight into phenomena through structured or unstructured data. This article will describe this process in detail in terms of purpose and method, including upload, tidy and visualization. In addition, the dataset of world Internet users was processed to conclude that the number of Internet users in Africa, the Americas and Europe accounted for more than 50\% of the total population of each continent, Asia and Oceania for more than 30\%, and finally the Middle East for 10 percent. In the example above, the basic profile of Internet users on each continent and the differences between each other can be seen very clearly and intuitively. This process of using data visualization to make it usable can be seen in all walks of life.},

	abstract = {How do analysis goals and context affect exploratory data analysis ({EDA})? To investigate this question, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 data analysts. We characterize common exploration goals: profiling (assessing data quality) and discovery (gaining new insights). Though the {EDA} literature primarily emphasizes discovery, we observe that discovery only reliably occurs in the context of open-ended analyses, whereas all participants engage in profiling across all of their analyses. We describe the process and challenges of {EDA} highlighted by our interviews. We find that analysts must perform repetitive tasks (e.g., examine numerous variables), yet they may have limited time or lack domain knowledge to explore data. Analysts also often have to consult other stakeholders and oscillate between exploration and other tasks, such as acquiring and wrangling additional data. Based on these observations, we identify design opportunities for exploratory analysis tools, such as augmenting exploration with automation and guidance.},
